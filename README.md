## Project: Web Scraping

## Author: Mike Shen

## Description:
Scrape a Wikipedia page of your choosing and record which passages need citations.

E.g. History of Mexico has a few “citations needed”.

Your web scraper should report the number of citations needed.

Your web scraper should identify those cases AND include the relevant passage.

E.g. Citation needed for “lorem spam and impsum eggs”

Consider the “relevant passage” to be the parent element that contains the passage, often a paragraph element.
